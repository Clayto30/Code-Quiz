# Code Quiz
​
## Description 
​
Coding Bootcamp is ramping up in challenge, and to keep up with the increased difficulty, we need a 
new way to stay up to speed! Well, enter my Coding Quiz! 

Just go ahead and load it up and give it a try! You will lose 10 seconds for every wrong answer. You will
gain fifteen seconds for every right answer! If the timer runs out, you lose! Refresh the page and give it 
another go! Trust me, when things seem impossible, there IS a way ahead. If you win, your score will be reported back
to you. Unfortunately, our ability to enter initials and save them to the page is not yet functional. Sorry, folks! :(
​
​While I would have loved to demonstrate that I could save to storage and display that information, setting up this
quiz presented quite a challenge, and I was left with too little time. I hope y'all can understand! ;) 
​
​The application is deployed at 
(https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
​​
## Table of Contents (Optional)
​
If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
​
* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Credits](#credits)
* [License](#license)
​
​
## Installation
​
Simply head to the page, and try to answer the questions correctly! The timer is running, so click the button of the
answer that you think is right. The pressure is on!
​​
## Usage 
​
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. 
​
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
​

​
## Credits
​
UCB Extension Coding Bootcamp designed this challenge for me to demonstrate what I have learned. They provided the 
mockup and the funtionality that I tried to accomplish. 

My TA, John Baxter, provided invaluable assistance.
